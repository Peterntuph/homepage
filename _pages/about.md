Kuan-Hung Yeh is currently a full-time research assistant working at [Taiwan Public Health Association](http://www.publichealth.org.tw/english/index.asp). He received B.Sc. degree from [Department of Public Health](http://coph.ntu.edu.tw/web/index/index.jsp?lang=en) at National Taiwan University in June 2020. During the year 2020, He decides to perform 4-month compulsory military service before pursuing the Master's degree. With the career goal of bridging the gap between health data researches and interventions, He aims to pursue an MS degree in Biostatistics start from 2021.

In college, He was fascinated by the great impact research has on shaping policies and public health decision-making. Towards this sprouting career goal, he joined the lab supervised by Prof. [Tzu-Pin Lu](https://scholars.lib.ntu.edu.tw/cris/rp/rp06647/information.html) and gradually developed his research experience on related topics, such as prognostic modeling in survival analysis and GWAS study. However, the difficulty of figuring out causation between biomarker and phenotype puzzled him until he took the Class of statistical thinking and read The Book of Why written by Judea Pearl. He was inspired that the determination of an association is causal indicates the possibility for more reliable interventions. Currently, His research interest lies at the intersection of **Causal Inference** and **Statistical Genetics**, recently on the development and application of novel Mendelian Randomization to control the pleiotropic effects.
